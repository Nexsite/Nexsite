# About Me
Hi, I'm a 17-year-old self-taught web developer from Sri Lanka. I'm passionate about building things with code and always looking to improve by creating real-world projects. I'm currently learning React.js and Tailwind CSS to level up my frontend skills, and I enjoy working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. My goal is to become a full-stack developer, contribute to open-source, and keep growing every day. Thanks for visiting my profile!
